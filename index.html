<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Philadelphia Python Workshop.  We've updated our curriculum to use Python 3.
You can view our old curriculum on <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Python_Workshop">Open Hatch</a>.</p>

<p>The workshop is meant to be taught over 1.5 days.  We typically hold it Friday evening and all day Saturday as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li>Friday evening is self-paced.  Students install Python 3 and walk through tutorials that we have designed as well as some others.  TAs are available to help trouble shoot installation and setup. They are also available to help students with any of the Python and programming concepts they encounter in the tutorials.</li>

<li>Saturday is largely lecture based, with lead instructor(s) presenting basic concepts of programming in Python.  Mental health breaks and breaks to work on exercises independently should be built in to the lesson.  TAs are available to circulate answering individual questions during the lecture and during the breaks.</li>

<li>Projects are included as a way to see these programming concepts applied in practical ways.  Time permitting, we will delve into the code of these projects.</li>

</ul>
