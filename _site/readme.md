This is the curriculum guide for the Philly Python Workshop.

It's hosted on github pages and is maintained by [Alyssa Batula](https://github.com/abatula), [Sarah Gray](https://github.com/sarahelizgray), and [Maneesha Sane](https://github.com/maneesha).  The live site can be found at http://phillypythonworkshop.github.io/.

Want to help us develop it?  Fork this repo & clone it to your local machine.  You'll need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) & [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)installed. 

All pages are written in the [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) flavor of Markdown and live in the `/pages` directory. Edit the markdown files.  Run `jekyll serve` to run the site locally at http://127.0.0.1:4000/.  Run `jekyll build` to build the html from markdown in the `_site/ `.  Never edit anything here manually! Commit your changes in git, push to your GitHub repo, and send us a pull request.

Check out the repo's issues to see specific issues we'd like to fix or update.  Contact any of the maintainers with any questions or comments.
