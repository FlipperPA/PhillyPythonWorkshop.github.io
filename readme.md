This is the curriculum guide for the Philly Python Workshop.

It's hosted on github pages and is maintained by [Alyssa Batula](https://github.com/abatula), [Sarah Gray](https://github.com/sarahelizgray), and [Maneesha Sane](https://github.com/maneesha).  The live site can be found at http://phillypythonworkshop.github.io/.

Want to help us develop it?  Fork this repo & clone it to your local machine.  You'll need to have Ruby & Jekyll installed. Then, you'll be able to edit any of the pages in markdown and Jekyll will build the html.  We'll have more detailed instructions on how to do all this soon.

Check out the repo's issues to see specific issues we'd like to fix or update.  Contact any of the maintainers with any questions or comments.
