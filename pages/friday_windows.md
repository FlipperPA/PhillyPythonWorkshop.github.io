Here's what you need to do to set up your Windows machine.

Here's what you need to do to set up your Windows machine.

#Install Python
If you already think you have Python 3 installed, please check with a staff member before completing these instructions.

1.  Click on [this download link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3.msi) and choose "run" if you have the option to do so. Otherwise, save it to your computer and double click to start the installer.  Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

2.  Open a command prompt (we will be doing this multiple times, so make a note of how to do this!):
  * On Windows 8 search for "command prompt"
  * On Windows 7 or Vista click on the Start menu (the Windows logo in the lower left of the screen), type cmd into the Search field directly above the Start menu button, and click on "cmd" in the search results above the Search field.
  * On Windows XP click on the Start menu (the Windows logo in the lower left of the screen), click on "Run...", type cmd into the text box, and hit enter.

  You now have what's called a command prompt.  This command prompt is another way of navigating your computer and running programs -- just textually instead of graphically. We are going to be running Python and Python scripts from this command prompt.

3. At the command prompt (it should look like  `C:\`) type 
```
python34/python.exe
```
You should see something that looks like this:

```
Python 3.4.0 (default, Apr 11 2014, 13:05:11)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

You just started Python! The >>> indicates that you are at a new type of prompt -- a Python prompt. The command prompt lets you navigate your computer and run programs, and the Python prompt lets you write and run Python code interactively.

  * If the number after Python is not 3 or greater, please tell an instructor or assistant.


4. To exit the Python shell, type `exit()` and hit enter.  You'll now be back at the Windows command prompt (the `C:\` that you saw earlier).
