<p>While Macs come with Python 2.7.x pre-installed, we’ll be working with Python 3 during this session so there’s some light installation ahead of us. This will require administrative priveleges to your computer since the python installation is usually done to protected directories.</p>

<p>Along the way, we’ll also set up a more advanced text editor that will help us by providing some really specific programming features.</p>

<h1 id="installing-the-command-line-tools">Installing the Command-Line Tools</h1>

<p>If you don’t have the command line tools provided by Apple already set up, you’ll need to do that.</p>

<p>You can check whether you have them already by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>opening <code>Terminal</code> (you can find it in your <code>Utilities</code> directory inside of <code>Applications</code>)</li>
  <li>typing in the following and then pressing <code>enter</code>:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>gcc
</code></pre>

<p>If a pop-up shows up asking whether you’d like to install the Command Line tools, say Yes and follow the provided steps.
If nothing happens and the window just looks like nothing is happening, it means you’re already good to go! You can type in <code>CTRL+c</code> and your terminal will be ready for the following steps.</p>

<h1 id="installing-homebrew">Installing Homebrew</h1>

<p><a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package manager</a> for Mac. It will help us quickly install Python 3.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up the <code>Terminal</code> application (if you haven’t already)</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the following into the command window and press <code>enter</code></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</code></pre>

<p>During this process, you will prompted for your password (again, you’ll need to have administrative priveleges). Don’t worry if characters don’t show up as you type; that’s just how it keeps your password hidden from others’ prying eyes :) !</p>

<h1 id="installing-python3">Installing python3</h1>

<p>With Homebrew now installed, you can install <code>python3</code> with the following command in the <code>Terminal</code>.</p>

<pre><code>brew install python3
</code></pre>

<h1 id="testing-the-installation">Testing the installation</h1>

<p>You can test that your installation went well by running the <code>python3</code> interpreter in the <code>Terminal</code>. </p>

<p>Enter the following into the terminal and press <code>enter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3
</code></pre>

<p>You should then see something like,</p>

<pre><code>Python 3.5.0 (default, Sep 14 2015, 02:37:27) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>While inside the python interpreter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> indicates that you are at a Python prompt.</li>
  <li>You can exit the Python prompt by typing <code>exit()</code> and pressing enter or by using <code>CTRL+d</code>. </li>
  <li>Practice doing this a few times until you are comfortable entering and exiting the Python shell.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="installing-a-text-editor-sublime">Installing a Text Editor (Sublime)</h1>

<p>While you can absolutely write python code in TextEdit (make sure you’ve turned off rich text editting), it is a lot easier to use a text editor that is more aware of code content. To that end, we’ll be using Sublime Text 3. While there are a multitude of other options, Sublime 3 provides a good blend of simplicity and functionality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Download it from here</a></p>

<p>Once downloaded, install it as you would any other OS X application. Being explicit, this means double-clicking the downloaded <code>dmg</code> file, letting it open up, and subsequently dragging the <code>Sublime Text</code> application into your <code>Applications</code> folder. </p>
