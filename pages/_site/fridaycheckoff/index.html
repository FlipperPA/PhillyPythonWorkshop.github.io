<p>When youâ€™re ready, let an instructor or assistant know.  Together you will go through the following check off steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start a new command prompt, and from that command prompt start Python. Then quit Python.</li>
  <li>Create a new Python file (with a <code>.py</code> extension).  In that file, type</li>
</ol>

<p><code>print("Hello world!")</code></p>

<p>and save the file.  From a command prompt, navigate to this file and execute that Python script.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open your text editor and press <code>Tab</code>. Use the left arrow key to go back in that line and show that your text editor is using spaces to indent, not tabs.  </li>
  <li>Test the Wordplay and ColorWall installations.  (Instructions coming soon.)</li>
  <li>Show the instructor a practice exercise that seemed particularly challenging and how you worked it out.</li>
</ol>
