This is the self-guided, self-paced tutorial for Friday evening.  We've included a break in the middle, but remember to take a break to stretch, get some water, take a moment to relax any time you need to.

As you go through this tutorial, any time you see something like this:

`a = "Hello"`

it's something that you can type in at the `>>>` prompt in your Python shell.  Hit Return or Enter after every line and note the output (although sometimes there won't be any!).  Don't copy and paste -- you'll learn much better if you take the time to type everything yourself.

###Math

Math in Python looks a lot like math with a calculator.

####Addition

`2 + 2`

`1.65 + 2.15`

####Subtraction

`12 - 5`

`45.9 - 25.3`

`45.9 - 61.7`

####Multiplication
Multiplication uses the `*` (asterisk or star) symbol.

`6 * 7`

`5.6 * 4.3`

####Division
Division uses the `/` symbol.

`12/3`

`16/5`

> Note: If you've used Python 2, you'll see that division works differently in Python 3.  Python 2 uses floor division for integers, meaning it will return only the whole number part of the answer. Python 3 performs true division, returning the real or true value of the division.
